# Techouse MRP (ths_mrp) for Odoo 18

## Summary

This module, developed by Techouse Solutions, extends the "Effective Date" functionality provided by the **Techouse Base (ths_base)** module into Odoo 18's Manufacturing (MRP) and Unbuild operations. It ensures that manufacturing-related stock movements and accounting entries are posted according to a specified effective date, typically derived from the Manufacturing Order's planned date.

**Requires the 'Techouse Base' module to be installed first.**

## Key Features

* **Effective Date for Manufacturing Orders:**
    * An "Effective Date" (`ths_effective_date`) is added to Manufacturing Orders (MOs).
    * This date is automatically calculated based on the MO's "Planned Date" (`date_start`).
    * The Effective Date controls the date used for component consumption moves, finished product moves, and related accounting entries when the MO is marked as done.
* **Effective Date for Unbuild Orders:**
    * An "Effective Date" (`ths_effective_date`) is added to Unbuild Orders.
    * This date is automatically derived from the linked Manufacturing Order's Effective Date, ensuring consistency.
    * If no MO is linked, it defaults to the current date but can be manually adjusted.
    * The Effective Date controls the date used for the stock moves generated by the unbuild operation and any related accounting.
* **Improved Journal Entry References:**
    * Adds references to the source Manufacturing Order or Unbuild Order in the reference field (`ref`) of associated Journal Entries for easier tracking.

## Dependencies

* **`ths_base`**: Essential for the core `ths_effective_date` field and underlying logic on `stock.move`.
* `mrp`
* `stock_account`

## Installation

1.  Ensure the `ths_base` module is already installed.
2.  Copy the `ths_mrp` module folder into your Odoo addons directory.
3.  Restart the Odoo server process (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart odoo`).
4.  Log in to your Odoo instance with administrator rights.
5.  Activate Developer Mode (Settings -> General Settings -> Activate the developer mode).
6.  Navigate to the "Apps" menu.
7.  Click "Update Apps List" in the Apps menu (top bar).
8.  Remove the default "Apps" filter and search for "Techouse MRP".
9.  Click the "Install" button on the `ths_mrp` module card.

## Configuration

There is no specific configuration required for this module beyond ensuring `ths_base` is installed and configured as needed.

## Usage

* The "Effective Date" on Manufacturing Orders is automatically set from the "Planned Date". When the MO is marked as done, all related stock moves and accounting entries will use this date.
* The "Effective Date" on Unbuild Orders is automatically set from the linked MO's date. If needed (e.g., no MO linked), you can manually set the "Effective Date" before clicking "Unbuild" to control the date of the resulting stock moves.
